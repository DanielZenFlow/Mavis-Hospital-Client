1	General information about the programming project

The goal of the project is to construct an advanced client for the MAvis server using the hospital domain.  So essentially the problem is the same as in the warmup assignment, except here we expect you to experiment with advanced techniques and architectures to be able to solve the widest possible range of multiagent levels within the hospital domain eciently. The client of the warmup assignment is not particularly ne-tuned or ecient, so you are strongly encouraged to rebuild your own client from scratch.   You can obviously take inspiration in the warmup assignment, but building your own client from scratch and thinking about how to e.g. represent states eciently is a very valuable exercise, and will also make it easier for you to afterwards extend the client with more features.

1.1	Expectations and conditions

The project is purposely designed to be very open-ended and exible, allowing many dierent group sizes, types of solutions and levels of ambition. Successful implementations of the project range all the way from basic solutions using standard techniques to highly research relevant multi-agent systems. Some overall expectations and conditions:

•  Signicantly more advanced than warmup assignment.  A basic extension of the warmup assignment will not count as a sucient solution.  You are not going to be able


1




to create an ecient client by simply further tweaking the heuristics and/or use a slightly modied variant of graph search. What you deliver in the programming project has to be signicantly more advanced and ecient than what you did in the warmup assignment.

•  Only  multiagent.   In the programming project,  you will only work with multi-agent levels. You might of course use single-agent levels to try out your algorithms for controlling the individual agents of a multi-agent system, but in the nal competition all levels will be multi-agent levels.

•  Workload. The programming project constitutes approximately 3.75 of the 7.5 ECTS in the course. This means that the expected total workload of the programming project is ap-proximately 100 hours per student (including participating in the competition, preparing the video, etc).

1.2	Groups and group sizes

Ideally you keep your group from the warmup assignment. However, this is not a strict require-ment, you are allowed to restructure if you nd it necessary.  The same conditions regarding group sizes apply as for the warmup assignment:  Group sizes can range from 2 to 5 students with 3{4 as the recommended numbers.  Groups of 2 will be expected to deliver the same as groups of 3. Groups of 2 students are by default not encouraged as it gives you a bit too few resources for a project of this size and level of ambition. Groups of 5 students are also by default not recommended as it can be hard to distribute tasks between you in such a large group. But if you think you can manage and are able to handle your project management eciently, it will of course give you more ressources to create a nice solution.  Groups of 4{5 are expected to deliver a somewhat more substantial and thorough solution to the assignment than a group of 3, however, of course realising that a group of 4 can’t necessarily produce 30% more than a group of 3, and similarly when going from 4 to 5.

1.3	Competition

Towards the end of the course there will be a competition where your dierent clients will com-pete against each other. You will be given a number of multi-agent levels, and your implemented client should then try to complete each level as fast as possible and using as few joint actions as possible. Some details and conditions:

•  3  minute  time-out.  In the competition, the environment server will time out clients after 3 minutes, so your AI only has 3 minutes to complete each level.

•  20.000 joint actions limit.  Your client can use at most 20.000 joint actions to solve a level, otherwise it counts as unsolved.

•  Two scores per level:  action score and time score.  Your client will get two scores for each level, an action score and a time score. The action score is for number of actions in the solution found (fewer actions = better score). The time score is for computation time (less time = better score). The time score is logarithmic to avoid groups being too harshly penalised for running their client on less powerful hardware, or in a computationally less ecient programming language.

•  Prizes and winners. Time and action scores will be summed up and there will be prizes for the groups with the best overall action score and the best overall time score.  There will also be a prize for the most interesting level submitted to the competition.  As an unsolved level gives a score of 0, your rst priority in designing the solution should always be to be able to solve as many levels as possible within 3 minutes and 20.000 joint actions.

1.4	Assessment of the programming project

The assessment of the programming project will be based on

•  Algorithmic ideas.  The novelty of the algorithmic ideas that you have come up with. How interesting are they, how general are they, how well do they perform in your imple-mentation?

•  Video presentation.  How clear and technically precise have you presented your algo-rithmic ideas? How well have you followed the instructions in guide for video.pdf.

The goal of the competition is to motivate you to make the most ecient possible solution, and to allow comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of the various submitted solutions. Your result in the competition will not directly aect your grade.  A group might for instance challenge itself by trying out advanced novel techniques or focus mostly on optimising a certain aspect of the solution, e.g. multi-agent communication and coordination.   That group might not be able to produce the most ecient solution,  but the novelty and quality of both the algorithmic ideas and the video could still be very high.

2	Schedule and detailed instructions

2.1	Submission of your competition level

You should design and submit one multi-agent level (i.e., containing at least 2 agents).  The deadline is

13 May at 20.00

The submitted level will be included in the set of competition levels, but only if it meets all of the following conditions:

1.  Level size limit 50x50. Your level is required to be of size at most 50x50 grid cells. No tab characters.

2.  Correct format. The level satises all format requirements in hospital_domain.pdf.

3.  Solvable  by  own  client.   Your own client can solve the level within the 20.000 joint actions limit and 3 minutes limit.

4.  Correct naming.  Pick a group name of at most 9 letters (restricted to the letters a-z and  A-Z),  e.g.  TheMAtrix,  MASochist  or  NoOp.   This  will  be  your  group  name  in  the competition,  so  choose  wisely!   Your  le  name  must  then  be  <group_name>.lvl,  e.g. TheMAtrix.lvl.  Important:  The name of the level after the #levelname line inside the le must also be <group_name>!

2.2	Release of competition levels

The competition levels will be made available in complevels.zip under Content/Programming Project on DTU Learn on

15 May at 20.00

Download and unpack the zip le in a separate directory and then run the server with the following command (note that each level takes up to 3 minutes, so this command could run for several hours):

java  -jar  server.jar  -c  "<client-cmd>"  -l  "<path-to-complevels-dir>" -t  180  -o  "<group-name>"

Here <group-name> must be the same as you used when submitting your competition level (see Section 2.1. It produces these les:

•  <group-name>.zip:  log les for all the competition levels.  Unzip to check how you did. To replay a log le, use

java  -jar  server.jar  -r  "<path-to-logfile>"  -g

Check that your client is correctly identifying itself with your group name by inspecting the top bar in the replay window. It should say \Client: <group-name>".

•  summary.txt: a summary of the actions and time spent on each level.

•  <group-name>.out: an encrypted le with the competition results. This is the one to be handed in, see Section 2.3.

2.3	Submission of competition results

The deadline for submitting the results of running the competition levels on your client as well as your source code is

19 May at 20.00

To be handed in:

1.  <group-name>.out: The le produced by running the server on the competition levels, see Section 2.2. Make sure your client identies itself with your group name, see Section 2.2.

2.  code.zip:  A zip-le containing all the source code and executable code of your imple-mented software. No .rar, .tar, .gz or other formats, please!

2.4	The competition

The presentation of the competition results will take place on

22 May 14.00-18.00

It doesn’t take place in the standard auditorium, so check the schedule for which room it is. Requirements:

4




•  1  minute  presentations.   Each  group  should  be  prepared  to  give  a  short  1  minute explanation of the behaviour of their client on any of the competition levels.

•  Required  presence.   It’s the ocial day of examination in the course,  so by default everybody should be able to participate.  In rare cases, some students have other exams on that day,  and can of course be excused.   Just make sure that there is at least one representative from your group present.

During the event, we will present the detailed scores of all groups, present head-to-head battles between pairs of clients running on the same level, and announce winners. There will be snacks, drinks and prizes.

2.5	Submission of video

The deadline for submitting your video is

3 June at 20.00

Requirements:

1.  Follow the ocial video instructions. Make sure to read and follow all the instructions and advice given in the separate document guide_for_video.pdf.

2.  Include a group declaration. Your rst slide should include a group declaration spec-ifying who did what in the project, in terms of ideas, literature search, implementation, preparation of the video, etc (with the same overall conditions as for the warmup assign-ment).

3.  Include relevant demos.  Include relevant demos in your video, as a minimum a video demo of your client running on your own level, including an analysis of its behaviour (why is it doing what it’s doing? How could it potentially be improved?).

4.  Maximal  length  is  12  minutes.	The  length  of  the  video  should  be  at  most  12 minutes for groups of any size.  Anything after the 12 minute mark will not be watched and assessed.





Good luck with your project. Be creative! Have fun!
